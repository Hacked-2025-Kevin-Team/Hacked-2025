    "summary": "The study investigates the effect of synthetic Aluminium-Magnesium Silicate (AMS) on the antiplasmodial activity of chloroquine phosphate in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. The research revealed that incorporating AMS with chloroquine enhanced its efficacy in reducing parasitaemia and improved survival rates in infected mice, particularly at lower doses of chloroquine (5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg). The findings suggest that AMS may stabilize chloroquine, allowing for higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream for longer periods, thus combating the rising resistance of malaria against chloroquine. Additionally, lower doses of chloroquine combined with AMS appear to mitigate the drug's toxic effects, which tend to increase mortality in higher dosage groups due to chloroquine toxicity.",
